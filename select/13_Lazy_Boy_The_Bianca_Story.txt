Can mercy lead and dance without
Someone getting closer, someone being close?
Is joy a little spoilt by being talked about
When everybody dreams alone?
Dreams about the other dreamin' 'bout the one
I do not care to bother, I'm not gonna run
First of all I'm a lazy boy
Seconds ago I fancied you
Third in the round is the place to be
And what's four?

As beautiful as grace can move
Could someone stop me longing for
Someone to belong to?
When anyway will isn't there
And everybody's still alone

Dreamin' 'bout the other who's dreaming 'bout the one
I don't care to bother, I'm not gonna run

First of all I'm a lazy boy
Seconds ago I fancied you
Third in the round is the place to be
And what's four?

First of all was it mercy's fault for being
Seconds away from telling joy the truth?
Third in the round I'll be falling for grace
But what for?

First of all I'm a lazy boy
Seconds ago I fancied you
Third in the round is the place to be
And what's four?
First of all I'm a lazy boy
Seconds away from telling you
Third in the round I could show you the truth
I could show you the truth
I could show you the truth
But what for?
