Do you wanna know,
Do you wanna know
Why I mumble like a drunk?
I ain't had a drink in 6 weeks,
What a nice streak,
Keeps me quiet as a monk

One warm case is better
Than another,
All because I'm listening
To shakedown street
One time through
Then over again,
Once then over again
And I'm in my zone

I traded my tears in for dumb
Suburban plants, and now
I drive 55 in my
White hybrid Sedan
Don't you tell me to light up,
I'm lit up like a tree
I traded my tears in and now
I'm free as I can be

Do you wanna see,
Do you wanna see
Why I dragged myself away
I can smell the rotting of
Flesh like a sixth sense,
Is it obvious enough

One more chase is
Never gonna do it,
All because I'm
Listening to Mambo Sun
One time through
Then over again,
Once then over again and
I'm fucking honed

I traded my tears in for dumb
Suburban plants, and now
I drive 55 in my
White hybrid sedan
Don't you tell me to light up,
I'm lit up like a tree
I traded my tears in and
Now I'm free as I can be
