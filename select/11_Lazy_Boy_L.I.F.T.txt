Putting myself into crises
Mixing the spirits with visual violence
Lusting for fame like the doctor prescribes it
Wait till the sound of the singular minded

You're not invited, we are divided
Breaking through glass and I smash into silence
Watching my body beneath of me crying
Try to ignore that my tears mean I'm dying

I sit in my arm chair and think of the despair
That circles my head as I sink into my—
Sit in my arm chair and think of the despair
That circles my head as I sink into my—

Lazy boy and misery
I blow my brains out on T.V.
I'm the static on your screen
Turn it up to hear me scream

Please leave me alone, leave me alone
Knock on my door but I'll never be home
Stuck in a place where there's nowhere to run
Nothing but white noise, the walls, and a gun

Leave me alone, I'm apocalypse head
Expecting the world and neglecting his dead
My singular goal to ascend from the depths
Of below my own body but I never rest

I sit in my arm chair and think of the despair
That circles my head as I sink into my—
Sit in my arm chair and think of the despair
That circles my head as I sink into my—

Lazy boy and misery
I blow my brains out on T.V.
I'm the static on your screen
Turn it up to hear me scream
Lazy boy and misery
I blow my brains out on T.V.
I'm the static on your screen
Turn it up to hear me scream

(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
I blow my brains out on T.V.
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Turn it up to hear me scream
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
I blow my brains out on T.V.
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
(Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Turn it up to hear me scream

Lazy boy and misery
I blow my brains out on T.V.
I'm the static on your screen
Turn it up to hear me scream
Lazy boy and misery
I blow my brains out on T.V.
I'm the static on your screen
Turn it up to hear me scream
